# Pedagogical Machine Simulation

## Overview
This project is a pedagogical tool designed to simulate the motion of a system of three bodies under the influence of gravity and friction. It provides a Python implementation that calculates the accelerations and positions over time of each object, given their masses and friction coefficients. This simulation can be used for educational purposes to demonstrate the dynamics of physical systems in a visually engaging way.

## Features
- **Acceleration Calculation:** Computes the accelerations of three masses based on provided mass values and friction coefficients.
- **Position Simulation:** Tracks the positions of each mass over time as they move under the influence of their calculated accelerations.
- **Visualization:** Generates scatter plots with arrows to visually represent the movement paths of the bodies, enhancing the understanding of their dynamic interactions.
